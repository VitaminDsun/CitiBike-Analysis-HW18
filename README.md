# CitiBike Analysis - Homework 18

## Tableau Homework 18

Explore the Citi Bike data from January 2020 to September 2020 with this Tableau workbook. The data is visualized and analyzed to answer several questions regarding bike ridership in the city.

### Overview

This Tableau workbook focuses on data from the Citi Bike service, allowing you to analyze and visualize bike ridership in the city. It compares the data from January 2020 to September 2020. To accomplish this, the data from various months was combined into one dataset and analyzed using Tableau Public.

### Questions Answered with This Workbook

1. **Starting and Ending Stations**: Discover the number of riders who used specific stations as both their start and endpoint for trips.
2. **Subscriber vs. Customer Analysis**: Differentiate between the number of subscribed riders and new customers.
3. **Gender Analysis**: Examine the gender distribution of bike riders.

### Observations

After thorough data analysis, the following key observations were made:

- Major Starting Points: Five or six significant starting points in the city were identified, with over 32.5 million riders using the "Sip Ave" station as their starting point. The most popular starting location was "Grove St Path," with over 54.2 million riders, all located near the city center.

- Predominant Ending Location: A significant number of riders tend to end their trips at "Liberty Light Rail" station, with over 34 million riders. In contrast, the number of trips ending at other locations is notably lower, with the next highest being 23.2 million. This suggests that there are more diverse ending locations, possibly due to riders leaving bikes where convenient.

### Workbook Summary

- Gender Distribution: The data reveals that there were more male riders than female riders in the city, with men almost doubling the number of women.

- Subscriber vs. Customer: The number of subscribers is higher than expected, which is logical since trying the service may lead to more subscriptions. As a result, the number of new customers is expected to decrease over time, while the number of subscribers continues to grow.
