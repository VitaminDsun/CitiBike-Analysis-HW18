after i salected the months i wanted to analize from the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. This workbook compares the city bike data for January 2020 - September 2020 I then combinded the data in to one dataset and then used it in tableau public a few question I was able to look into 


# Questions being answered with this workbook

-The number of riders that used each station as a start point and an endpoint for their trip
-The number of subscribed rider and the number of new customers 
-The gender of the riders and the amount of riders 

# Observations

after looking in to the data, I was able to see that there are 5 or 6 major starting points in the city that a ton of people use in the 9 month period. with about 32,576,220 riders using the sip Ave station alone to start their trip. This being the 5 most popular starting point and the most popular starting location being Grove set Path, with over 54,219,348 riders using this spot all of these being around the center of the city. 

On the other had a lot of people seem to end their trip in one major location, and that’s liberty light rail station with 34,096,756 over. All the amount of trips ending in other locations is surprising low with the next location only  being 23,190,663. This was an interesting discovery this shows that there are a lot more ending locations. people seem to use them a lot more then when starting their trip this might be because they must know of the start location and head there to start their trip but once they are done riding they just end up leaving the bikes where ever they can there does not seem to be a reason to go to the popular start spots when you can just end your trip at a closer location.

# Overview 

I was also able to see that there are more male riders, then women riders in the city with men almost doubling the number of women.

and lastly the number of customers that are subscribed is higher, Than I was expecting but it makes sense that once you try it once you are more . likely to subscribe to the service so that will always be increasing, and the number of new customers will be always going down.
